🦠 Malaria Diagnosis Using Deep Learning
Automated detection of malaria-infected blood cells using TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
📌 Overview

This project implements an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for automatic malaria diagnosis using microscopic blood cell images. Leveraging the TensorFlow Malaria Dataset, it trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as Parasitized or Uninfected.

The system uses:

TensorFlow for model development

NumPy for preprocessing and numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization and performance analysis

This project demonstrates how AI can support disease diagnosis by providing fast, reliable, and scalable image-based screening.
